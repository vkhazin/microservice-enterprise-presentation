* [Mini-services](https://thenewstack.io/miniservices-a-realistic-alternative-to-microservices/): a coarser grain approach
* [Serverless](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html): code runs in managed, ephemeral containers
* [Low Code/No Code](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2017/07/20/the-low-codeno-code-movement-more-disruptive-than-you-realize/#71d06b09722a): business can build functional apps and professional developers, streamlining and simplifying business tasks
* Maybe more of a software archeology today:
  * [.Net Remoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Remoting) and [Java RMI](https://www.javatpoint.com/RMI)
  * [DCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model)
  * [CORBA](http://www.corba.org/)
