* We get it! Micro-services seem to make sense, but...
* Make sure they are not too granular - make them bigger
* It will be harder to manage versions and to deploy to environments!
* What happens to data integrity in our database?
* What micro-service is going to be the system of record?
* It will be a nightmare to trace errors if there are too many of micro-services!
